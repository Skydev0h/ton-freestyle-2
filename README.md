# The code is contained in [another repository](https://github.com/Skydev0h/ton-freestyle)
**This repository was initially created because @jobsbot does not accept two same links.**

But I have code for two projects in one repository.

---

Now this repository is repurposed for second part of Blockchain Challenge 2 to host the web page.

**In case there would be any problems with YouTube,** videos in 1080 quality are in mp4 folder.
